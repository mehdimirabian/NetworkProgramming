I created a five node network in node.config the way they are connected is as following
A is connected to B and C, then B and C are connected to each other, then B is connected to D,
and C is connected to E, then D and E are also connected. the Virtual addresses of these nodes 
are as followed:
A => 192.0.0.1
B => 192.0.0.2
C => 192.0.0.3
D => 192.0.0.4
E => 192.0.0.5

by running rserver 192.0.0.1 520 the first node will be alive and so on.
