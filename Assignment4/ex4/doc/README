To compile:

Use make command in project folder,
after that the executable myserver should be generated in the bin folder.

To execute:

change directory to bin folder. Then use this command

./myserver

Be default, the proxy server waits on port 28888. You can change this
by specifying the port in the command line. For example,

./myserver 31231

Design

The proxy server, when start up, create a TCP server on the required port,
and accepts the client. When a new client is accepted, the server forks
a new process to handle that client. The new process (in the handle function)
first reads the request from the client, then parse the request method, uri,
and protocol from the request. If it's an acceptable request, it then parses
the host from the request and checks
the filter list (loaded from forbidden-sites file when the proxy starts up)
to check whether the host should be filtered or forwarded.
If it should be forwarded, it creates a TCP connection with the HTTP server,
and send the request to the HTTP server. After that, the proxy server reads
the data from the HTTP server and sends it directly back to the client.

To terminate the process gracefully, the proxy server registers SIGCHLD handler
to wait on the finished child processes. In addition, the proxy server registers
SIGINT handler, which closes the server socket and log file when Ctrl-C is entered
to shutdown the proxy server.
