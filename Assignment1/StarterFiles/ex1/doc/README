NOTE: all makefiles were provided by the TA, and they work perfectly fine.

What works, and what doesn't:
everything works the only problem is that as you will see, I print the results of
the command in both ends, the way the results are shown in the client side, they're 
not completely alligned like they are on the server side, I couldn't find out why.
Everything else seems to work.
